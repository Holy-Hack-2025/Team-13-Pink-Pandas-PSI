In an ideal cargo reception process, incoming shipments should be arranged prior to the vehicle arriving and information on incoming shipments communicated to the warehouse team in advance. The consignment contents and volume, and possibly even a scanned copy of a packing list and/or waybill will be communicated in advance as well. In any situation, vehicles approaching the warehouse or storage facility should be instructed to call at least one hour in advance to ensure the warehouse can adequately receive and offload the vehicle. In storage facilities with busy operations, the vehicle will need to be scheduled for a specific time for offloading. If at any time a dispatch is not possible (damaged, expired items, or item cannot be found) the requesting party should be notified, and the release order modified. If not possible to reject items (internal transfer) damaged or expired items should be separated from the main consignment and placed in a well-marked location, to be repaired or disposed of later. If a single organisation is moving cargo between two warehouses/storage locations, it should be relatively easy to provide advanced delivery information to the receiving location.
