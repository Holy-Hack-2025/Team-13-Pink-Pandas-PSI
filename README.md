# **GenAI Documentation Assistant** 

## **Overview**
Welcome to **GenAI Documentation Assistant**, an AI-powered tool designed to **simplify complex project documentation** for different users based on their **expertise level, focus area, and preferred format** (text, audio, or visual).

### **Why This Matters?**
