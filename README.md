# **BrieflyAI - GenAI Documentation Assistant** 

## **Overview**
Welcome to **BrieflyAI**, an AI-powered web tool  designed to **simplify complex project documentation** for different users based on their **expertise level, focus area, and preferred format** (text, audio, or visual).

### **Why This Matters?**
📌 Lengthy and technical documentation often creates **barriers to understanding**.  
📌 Business users, developers, and stakeholders interpret the same document **differently**.  
📌 Traditional documentation lacks **adaptive learning** and **multimodal explanations**.  

GenAI bridges this gap by providing **personalized, AI-driven explanations** that **adapt** to each user's role and knowledge level.
