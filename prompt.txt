**Image Generation Prompt:**

"Create a detailed and professional illustration depicting an ideal cargo reception process at a transport company's warehouse. The scene should include:  

1. **Preparation:** A warehouse team organizing incoming shipments on pallets or shelves *before* the vehicle arrives, with clear communication lines shown (e.g., a worker using a tablet or computer to view advance shipment information).  
2. **Advanced Information:** A scanned packing list, waybill, and consignment details displayed on a digital screen or tablet, emphasizing the pre-arrival communication.  
3. **Vehicle Scheduling:** A delivery truck approaching the warehouse, with a driver communicating via radio or phone to confirm their arrival one hour in advance as per instructions.  
4. **Efficient Offloading:** A scheduled offloading process with workers unloading a truck in an organized manner, using forklifts or pallet jacks in a busy but smooth operation.  
5. **Damage/Expiry Handling:** A designated area for damaged or expired items, clearly marked with signage (e.g., "Quarantine" or "Damaged Goods"), separate from the main consignment.  
6. **Inter-Warehouse Transfer:** A truck being loaded at one warehouse, with digital communication shown between two warehouse managers to ensure advanced delivery information is shared.  

The image should have a clean, modern, and professional aesthetic, with clear labels or visual cues to highlight each step of the process. Use a neutral color palette with pops of color to emphasize key elements (e.g., the quarantine area or digital screens). The overall tone should convey efficiency, organization, and seamless communication."  

This prompt will generate an image that visually communicates the ideal cargo reception process, making it easily understandable for a floor manager at a transport company.
